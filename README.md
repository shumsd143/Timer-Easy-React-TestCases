## Render Multiple Components

### What is your dream project that you'd like to make after you learn React?

- Display the name of the project and description of the project. Both of them should be in separate html elements
- Provide both the elements with data-ns-test attribute values as "project-name" and "project-description"
- write your code in App.js
